# Network
These commands are for Ubuntu (not sure about others)

## Basic commands
```bash
ping <ip | domain>  # ping
traceroute <ip | domain>  # traceroute
tracepath <ip | domain>  # traceroute
nslookup <ip | domain>  # nslookup

ip a  # show ip addresses + more
ip r  # show default route
```

## WiFi
```bash
nmcli d  # list devices  
nmcli r wifi on  # turn on wifi adapter  
nmcli d wifi on  # list available networks  
nmcli d wifi connect <ssid> password <password>  # connects to wifi. replace <ssid> and <password> with the actual values  

nmcli r wifi off  # disable wifi completely
```

### Release/Renew IP address
```bash
# you might need to install this package
sudo apt install isc-dhcp-client

# release and renew
sudo dhclient -r 
sudo dhclient

# chatgpt said it was suppposed to be like this, but for me it worked anyway
sudo dhclient -r wlp2s0
sudo dhclient wlp2s0

# check with this command
ip a
```

## Local DNS
Add DNS entry for your PC
You need to edit `/etc/hosts` file and add like something like this  
```
192.168.88.3   www.segedin.sk
```

> On Windows it's located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

## Set static IP
You need to edit `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml` or something similar, so it looks something like this  
```bash
network:
 version: 2
 renderer: NetworkManager
 ethernets:
   eth0:
     dhcp4: no
     addresses: [172.23.207.254/20]
     gateway4: 192.168.1.1
     nameservers:
         addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.8.4]
```

# Grub
Rebuild grub or something?  
Not really what it actually does  
When Grub does not behave as it supposed to, try this :)  
```
sudo grub-install --terget=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=EndeavourOS
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```


# Various
Commands that do not deserve full section, but deserves to be there  

`hostnamectl` - find info about OS and more  

Disable sleep on lid close  
```bash
# open this file
sudo nvim /etc/systemd/logind.conf

# write these lines
HandleLidSwitch=ignore
HandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore
# save and quit

# restart this process
sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
```


# Cool programs
Mostly useless programs, just for fun
