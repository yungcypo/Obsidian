zstd -19 --ultra input -o output.zst
```

# Users

## Adding

```shell

```

|     | Description                                                    |

`useradd -u 1009 -g users -G sales,research -m -c 'i really dont know much about this user...' ferko`

## Changing User Password

User doesn't have password by default

## Deleting user

```shell

| --- | -------------------------------------- |
| -r  | Delete user along with his home folder |

Filles that belong to user and are not in home folder will become **orphaned**

# Groups

## Creating group

```shell
groupadd -g 1006 name

| --- | ------------------------------ |
| -g  | Group ID (GID) of new group    |
| -r  | Assign GID from reserved space |

If GID is not provided while creating new group, the system will assign the next available GID, for example 1007

## Modifying group

```shell

groupmod -g 1008 name
```

\*When changing GID, files that belong to the group will become **orphaned**!

chown user:group file
chown :group file
```

# Network

These commands are for Ubuntu (not sure about others)

## Basic commands

```bash
ping <ip | domain>  # ping
traceroute <ip | domain>  # traceroute
tracepath <ip | domain>  # traceroute
nslookup <ip | domain>  # nslookup

ip a  # show ip addresses + more
ip r  # show default route
```

## WiFi

```bash
nmcli d  # list devices
nmcli r wifi on  # turn on wifi adapter
nmcli d wifi on  # list available networks
nmcli d wifi connect <ssid> password <password>  # connects to wifi. replace <ssid> and <password> with the actual values

nmcli r wifi off  # disable wifi completely
```

### Release/Renew IP address

```bash
# you might need to install this package
sudo apt install isc-dhcp-client

# release and renew
sudo dhclient -r
sudo dhclient

# chatgpt said it was suppposed to be like this, but for me it worked anyway
sudo dhclient -r wlp2s0
sudo dhclient wlp2s0

# check with this command
ip a
```

## Local DNS

Add DNS entry for your PC
You need to edit `/etc/hosts` file and add like something like this

```
192.168.88.3   www.segedin.sk
```

> On Windows it's located in `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`

## Set static IP

You need to edit `/etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml` or something similar, so it looks something like this

```bash
network:
 version: 2
 renderer: NetworkManager
 ethernets:
   eth0:
     dhcp4: no
     addresses: [172.23.207.254/20]
     gateway4: 192.168.1.1
     nameservers:
         addresses: [8.8.8.8,8.8.8.4]
```

# Grub

Rebuild grub or something?  
Not really what it actually does  
When Grub does not behave as it supposed to, try this :)

```
sudo grub-install --terget=x86_64-efi --efi-directory=/boot/efi --bootloader-id=EndeavourOS
sudo grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
```

# Various

Commands that do not deserve full section, but deserves to be there

`hostnamectl` - find info about OS and more

Disable sleep on lid close

```bash
# open this file
sudo nvim /etc/systemd/logind.conf

# write these lines
HandleLidSwitch=ignore
HandleLidSwitchDocked=ignore
# save and quit

# restart this process
sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
```

```bash
# stress testing
sudo apt install stress
stress --cpu 8 --io 4 --vm 4 --vm-bytes 1024M --timeout 10s
```

# Cool programs

Mostly useless programs, just for fun
